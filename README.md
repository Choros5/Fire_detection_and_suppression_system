This code is designed for a Fire Detection and Suppression System using the ESP32 microcontroller, various sensors, and actuators. It integrates Blynk, SIM800L GSM module, and Wi-Fi for remote monitoring and control. Below is a detailed breakdown of the code's functionality:

1. Blynk and Wi-Fi Setup
The code initializes Blynk and connects the ESP32 to a Wi-Fi network for cloud-based control and monitoring. It uses the following credentials:

BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID and BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME: These identify the specific Blynk template for the fire detection system.
auth[]: Blynk authentication token for linking the ESP32 to your Blynk project.
ssid[] and pass[]: Wi-Fi credentials for connecting the ESP32 to the internet.
2. Pin Definitions
Various components are connected to the ESP32:

Sensors:
MQ2_PIN: Gas sensor (MQ-2) for detecting gas levels.
DHT_PIN: DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor.
FLAME_SENSOR_PIN: Flame sensor to detect fires.
Actuators:
BUZZER_PIN: Buzzer for audio alerts.
WATER_PUMP_PIN: Water pump for fire suppression.
CO2_LED_PIN: LED indicating CO2 system activation.
HVAC_LED_PIN: LED for HVAC system activation.
Control Inputs:
BUTTON_PIN: Button for manual override or control.
SIM800L Communication:
Serial communication pins (SIM800_RX_PIN, SIM800_TX_PIN) for sending SMS alerts via the GSM module.
3. Threshold Definitions
The system monitors sensor values against defined thresholds to trigger alerts:

THRESHOLD_MQ2: Gas concentration threshold for triggering alerts.
THRESHOLD_TEMP: Temperature threshold for overheating.
THRESHOLD_HUMIDITY: Humidity threshold to detect abnormal levels.
4. Component Initializations
DHT11 sensor: Reads temperature and humidity.
LCD Display: The LiquidCrystal_I2C library is used to initialize and control a 16x2 LCD for displaying sensor readings.
Blynk: Handles connection to the Blynk cloud for remote monitoring.
SIM800L: GSM module for sending SMS alerts.
5. Timed Tasks
The code uses the BlynkTimer library to perform periodic tasks:

Sensor Checking: Runs every 2 seconds to read sensor data and check if any hazard thresholds are surpassed.
Buzzer Control: Manages the buzzer's beeping behavior based on the type of hazard.
6. Sensor Data Processing
Gas Level Monitoring: The system averages multiple gas sensor readings to reduce noise.
Temperature & Humidity: These values are read from the DHT11 sensor.
Flame Detection: A debounced method is used to ensure reliable flame detection (checking 5 times and confirming flame if detected at least 3 times).
7. Actuation Logic
Hazard Detection: If any threshold (gas, temperature, or humidity) is surpassed, the HVAC system is activated, warnings are logged, and alerts are sent via SMS and the Blynk app.
Fire Detection: If a flame is detected, the water pump and CO2 system are activated to suppress the fire.
Manual Overrides: The system allows for manual control of the HVAC, CO2, and water pump via the Blynk app.
8. Remote Control Using Blynk
The code allows manual control of various systems through Blynk's virtual buttons:

HVAC (V1): Manually control HVAC via Blynk.
CO2 System (V2): Manually control CO2 system via Blynk.
Water Pump (V3): Manually control the water pump via Blynk.
9. Buzzer Control
The buzzer behavior depends on the type of hazard:

Continuous Beeping: For flammable hazards (fire).
Intermittent Beeping: For non-flammable hazards (gas, temperature, humidity).
10. SMS Alerting
The code sends an SMS alert using the SIM800L GSM module when a hazard is detected. It supports sending different messages depending on the type of alert (e.g., gas, temperature, or fire).

11. Serial Monitoring
The system outputs sensor readings (gas, temperature, humidity, flame detection) to the serial monitor at defined intervals, allowing real-time debugging and monitoring.

Summary:
This system continuously monitors environmental conditions using various sensors and alerts the user via Blynk (mobile app) and SMS (GSM module). It also controls actuators like water pumps, HVAC, and CO2 systems to mitigate hazards like gas leaks or fires.
